SPEAKER_00: Hi, I'm Ebony DeLiva and I'm 5'9". Everybody loves a great deal, but what's the deal with some of the ones popping up in our inboxes these days? Like this one. for worth of food at the Sky Grill, one of my favorite restaurants. Oh wait, never mind. It's expired. Alright, here's another one. off of carpet cleaning. I could probably use that at some point. Oh. Too bad it's only good for today. Here's one I wasn't even shopping for. I did not sign up for this. And neither did you or your customers. If you're a merchant, there's a better way to take advantage of social discounting to attract new customers. And get this, actually get paid for doing it. When it comes to social deals, half off is twice as effective. That's the deal with Half Off Depot. In fact, when you think half off, think twice as effective. It's better shopping for customers, better compensation for merchants. Here's a deal right here. Gotta run. I've got shopping to do.
